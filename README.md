👋 Hello, world! I'm [Prachi Bansal]

🎓 Just graduated with a degree in Economics and a minor in data obsession.
📊 I turn numbers into stories, spreadsheets into insights, and caffeine into code.
💻 Currently diving headfirst into the wonderful world of data analysis, where Python, SQL, and a sprinkle of R are my closest companions.

🧠 What I'm into:

📈 Crunching data until it confesses the truth

📊 Building dashboards that even non-data folks find cool

🧹 Cleaning messy datasets like a digital Marie Kondo

🤖 Learning new tools (currently obsessed with Python, pandas, and Power BI)

🎯 Connecting data to real-world decisions and outcomes

🔭 What I’m working on:

✍️ Personal data projects (because why not analyze my Spotify habits?)

📚 Brushing up on machine learning & predictive analytics

💼 Looking for opportunities where I can solve real problems with data

🚀 Fun facts:

I once made a chart to prove my roommate eats 80% of the shared snacks

Excel pivot tables are my comfort zone

I speak fluent sarcasm and semi-fluent SQL
